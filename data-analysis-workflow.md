# This document outlines the workflow of data collection and analysis in Excel for Mini Project #1, labeled 

Data were imported into Excel and filtered based on two locations: 
1. Baltimore, MD
1. Lewes, DE

Data from Baltimore locations were further processed to include only locations which exist within Baltimore city limits. Some data points were designated as Baltimore, MD but truly occurred outside these boundaries. The raw data compiled for analysis are included [here](https://github.com/mehurlock94/comparing-baltimore-lewes-social-status/blob/main/Mini_Project_1_raw_data.xlsx).
